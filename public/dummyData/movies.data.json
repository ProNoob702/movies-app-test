Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a <a href=\"gladiator\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">gladiator</a> and rises through the ranks of the arena\n  to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.</p>\n  <p>Inspired by <a href=\"Daniel_P._Mannix\" title=\"wikilink\">Daniel P.\n  Mannix</a>'s 1958 book <em>Those About to Die</em> (formerly titled\n  <em>The Way of the Gladiator</em>), the film's script, initially written\n  by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks and Ridley Scott signed on to\n  direct the film. Principal photography, which began in January 1999 and\n  wrapped up in May of that year, was known to have a set of problems due\n  to the script being unfinished, with several of the cast complained\n  about the writing quality throughout the nineteen week shoot in <a\n  href=\"Fort_Ricasoli\" title=\"wikilink\">Fort Ricasoli</a>, <a href=\"Malta\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">Malta</a>.

It has been credited\n  with reinventing the <a href=\"sword-and-sandal\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">sword-and-sandal</a> genre and rekindling interest in\n  entertainment centered around the cultures of <a\n  href=\"culture_of_ancient_Greece\" title=\"wikilink\">ancient Greece</a>, <a\n  href=\"culture_of_ancient_Rome\" title=\"wikilink\">Rome</a>, and other time\n  periods throughout world history.

Emperor\n  <a href=\"Marcus_Aurelius\" title=\"wikilink\">Marcus Aurelius</a> tells\n  Maximus that his own son, <a href=\"Commodus\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">Commodus</a>, is unfit to rule and that he wishes\n  Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save <a href=\"Rome\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">Rome</a> from corruption and restore the <a\n  href=\"Roman_Republic\" title=\"wikilink\">republic</a>. Upon hearing this,\n  Commodus murders his father.</p>\n  <p>Commodus proclaims himself the new emperor, asking Maximus for his\n  loyalty, but the latter refuses. Maximus is arrested by the <a\n  href=\"Praetorian_Guard\" title=\"wikilink\">Praetorian Guard</a> and is\n  told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded,\n  he rides for his home near <a href=\"Trujillo,_Cáceres\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">Trujillo</a>, only to find his wife and son <a\n  href=\"crucified\" title=\"wikilink\">crucified</a>. Maximus buries them,\n  then collapses from his injuries. Slavers find him, and take him to the\n  city of <a href=\"Zuccabar\" title=\"wikilink\">Zucchabar</a> in the Roman\n  province of <a href=\"Mauretania_Caesariensis\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">Mauretania Caesariensis</a>, where he is sold to <a\n  href=\"Gladiator#Schools_and_training\" title=\"wikilink\">gladiator\n  trainer</a> Proximo.</p>\n  <p>Maximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills\n  helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other\n  gladiators: Hagen, a <a href=\"Germanic_peoples\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">German</a>; and Juba, a <a href=\"Numidia\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">Numidian</a>. Hagen related he fought with Maximus in\n  Germania, while Juba encourages him that he will meet his wife and\n  daughter in the afterlife. Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a\n  gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the\n  crowd\" to win his freedom.</p>\n  <p>When Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's\n  death, Proximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the <a\n  href=\"Colosseum\" title=\"wikilink\">Colosseum</a>. Disguised in a masked\n  helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a <a\n  href=\"Sacred_Band_of_Carthage\" title=\"wikilink\">Carthaginian</a> in a\n  re-enactment of the <a href=\"Battle_of_Zama\" title=\"wikilink\">Battle of\n  Zama</a>. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus\n  enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the\n  disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his true\n  identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is\n  compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and his guards are\n  held back from striking them down.</p>\n  <p>Maximus's next fight is against a legendary undefeated gladiator,\n  Tigris of <a href=\"Gaul\" title=\"wikilink\">Gaul</a>. Commodus has\n  arranged for several tigers to be set upon Maximus during the duel;\n  Maximus, however, prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but\n  Maximus spares his opponent's life; to that crowd chanted \"Maximus the\n  Merciful\". Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his\n  family's deaths, but the latter turns and walks away.</p>\n  <p>Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former\n  legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with <a href=\"Lucilla\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">Lucilla</a>, Commodus's sister; and Gracchus, an\n  influential <a href=\"Senate_of_the_Roman_Empire\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">senator</a>. They agree to have Maximus escape Rome to\n  join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the\n  <a href=\"Roman_Senate\" title=\"wikilink\">Roman Senate</a>. Commodus\n  learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the\n  conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the\n  Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks.\n  Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable\n  Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero,\n  where the latter is killed.</p>\n  <p>In an effort to win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus\n  to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the\n  match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms\n  Commodus, who demands a sword. Disgusted by his cowardly demeanor, the\n  Praetorian Guard refuses to aid him. Commodus produces a hidden knife,\n  but Maximus overpowers him and drives that same knife into Commodus's\n  throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for\n  political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator\n  Gracchus to be reinstated. As he dies, he has a vision where he reunites\n  with his wife and son. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of\n  Rome\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, leaving\n  the dead Commodus behind.</p>\n  <p>That night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of\n  Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died. He echoes Maximus'\n  words <a href=\"Afterlife\" title=\"wikilink\">that they will see each other\n  again</a>, \"but not yet\", as he leaves to reunite with his family.</p>\n  <h2 id=\"cast\">Cast</h2>\n  <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"Russell_Crowe\" title=\"wikilink\">Russell Crowe</a> as\n  Maximus Decimus Meridius: A <a href=\"Hispania\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">Hispano-Roman</a> <a href=\"legatus\"\n  title=\"wikilink\">legatus</a> forced into becoming a slave who seeks\n  revenge against Commodus.

Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws\n    of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal\n    life.</p>\n    <p>Kaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact <a\n    href=\"Dormammu_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">Dormammu</a> of the <a\n    href=\"Dark_Dimension_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)\" title=\"wikilink\">Dark\n    Dimension</a>, where time is non-existent, and destroys the London\n    Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the <a\n    href=\"New_York_Sanctum\" title=\"wikilink\">New York Sanctum</a>, killing\n    its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the <a\n    href=\"Cloak_of_Levitation_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">Cloak of Levitation</a>, only to be critically injured\n    during a skirmish. He teleports himself back to the hospital where\n    Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to\n    Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark\n    Dimension to sustain a long life, and Mordo becomes disillusioned with\n    her. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York, Kaecilius\n    mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying,\n    she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement\n    Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo\n    arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the\n    Dark Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and\n    save Wong, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates an endless <a\n    href=\"time_loop\" title=\"wikilink\">time loop</a> around himself and\n    Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally\n    gives in to Strange's bargain that he permanently leave Earth alone and\n    take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking\n    the endless loop.</p>\n    <p>Disgusted by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo\n    renounces his sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye,\n    which is revealed to hold an <a href=\"Infinity_Stone\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">Infinity Stone</a>, back to Kamar-Taj and takes up\n    residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong.

In a\n    <a href=\"post-credits_scene\" title=\"wikilink\">post-credits scene</a>,\n    Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses, telling\n    him that Earth has \"too many sorcerers\".</p>",

It is a <a href=\"film_adaptation\" title=\"wikilink\">film\n    adaptation</a> of the 1985 <a href=\"nonfiction\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">nonfiction</a> book <em><a href=\"Wiseguy_(book)\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">Wiseguy</a></em> by Pileggi.

To prepare for their roles in the film, De Niro,\n    Pesci and Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material\n    left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and\n    <a href=\"Ad_libitum#Drama\" title=\"wikilink\">ad-libbing</a> came out of\n    rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they\n    wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines\n    he liked most and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked\n    from during principal photography.</p>\n    <p><em>Goodfellas</em> premiered at the <a\n    href=\"47th_Venice_International_Film_Festival\" title=\"wikilink\">47th\n    Venice International Film Festival</a> on September 9, 1990, where\n    Scorsese was awarded with <a href=\"Silver_Lion\" title=\"wikilink\">Silver\n    Lion</a> for Best Director, and was released in the United States on\n    September 19, 1990, by <a href=\"Warner_Bros.\" title=\"wikilink\">Warner\n    Bros.</a> The film was made on a budget of $25 million, and grossed\n    $47 million. <em>Goodfellas</em> received widespread critical acclaim\n    upon release: the critical consensus on <a href=\"Rotten_Tomatoes\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">Rotten Tomatoes</a> calls it \"arguably the high point\n    of Martin Scorsese's career\". The film was nominated for six <a\n    href=\"Academy_Awards\" title=\"wikilink\">Academy Awards</a>, including <a\n    href=\"Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture\" title=\"wikilink\">Best Picture</a>\n    and <a href=\"Academy_Award_for_Best_Director\" title=\"wikilink\">Best\n    Director</a>, with Pesci winning for <a\n    href=\"Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor\" title=\"wikilink\">Best\n    Supporting Actor</a>.

The\n    three associates spend most of their nights in the 1960s at the <a\n    href=\"Copacabana_(nightclub)\" title=\"wikilink\">Copacabana nightclub</a>\n    carousing with women. Henry starts dating <a href=\"Karen_Friedman_Hill\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">Karen Friedman</a>, a Jewish woman who is initially\n    troubled by Henry's criminal activities. Seduced by Henry's glamorous\n    lifestyle, she marries him despite her parents' disapproval.</p>\n    <p>In 1970, <a href=\"William_Bentvena\" title=\"wikilink\">Billy Batts</a>,\n    a <a href=\"made_man\" title=\"wikilink\">made man</a> in the <a\n    href=\"Gambino_crime_family\" title=\"wikilink\">Gambino crime family</a>\n    recently released from prison, patronizes Tommy at a nightclub owned by\n    Henry; Tommy and Jimmy beat, stab and fatally shoot Billy. The\n    unsanctioned murder of a made man invites retribution; realizing this,\n    Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy bury the body in upstate New York. Six months\n    later, however, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for\n    development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decomposing\n    corpse.</p>\n    <p>In 1974, Karen harasses Henry's mistress, Janice, and threatens Henry\n    at gunpoint. Henry moves in with Janice, but Paulie insists that he\n    should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in <a\n    href=\"Tampa,_Florida\" title=\"wikilink\">Tampa</a> with Jimmy. Upon\n    returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the\n    gambler's sister, an FBI typist, and they receive ten-year prison\n    sentences. To support his family on the outside, Henry has Karen smuggle\n    in drugs and sells them to a fellow inmate from <a href=\"Pittsburgh\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">Pittsburgh</a>.</p>\n    <p>In 1978, Henry is paroled and expands his cocaine business with Jimmy\n    and Tommy against Paulie's orders. Jimmy organizes a crew to raid the <a\n    href=\"Lufthansa_heist\" title=\"wikilink\">Lufthansa vault</a> at <a\n    href=\"John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport\" title=\"wikilink\">John F.\n    Kennedy International Airport</a>, stealing six million dollars in cash\n    and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy's\n    orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew\n    (except Tommy and Henry) murdered. In 1979, Tommy is deceived into\n    believing he is to become a made man and is murdered after walking into\n    the room of <a href=\"Initiation_ritual_(mafia)\" title=\"wikilink\">the\n    \"ceremony\"</a>—partly as retribution for murdering Batts, which\n    infuriates Jimmy.</p>\n    <p>By 1980, Henry develops a drug habit and becomes a paranoid wreck. He\n    sets up another drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates but is arrested\n    by narcotics agents and incarcerated. After bailing him out, Karen\n    explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to\n    prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving them\n    penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's drug dealing, Paulie gives him\n    $3,200 and ends their association. Henry meets Jimmy at a diner and is\n    asked to travel on a hit assignment, but the novelty of such a request\n    makes him suspicious. Henry realizes that Jimmy plans to have him and\n    Karen killed, prompting his decision to become an <a href=\"informant\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">informant</a> and enroll, with his family, into the <a\n    href=\"United_States_Federal_Witness_Protection_Program\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">witness protection program</a>. After giving sufficient\n    testimony and evidence to have Paulie and Jimmy convicted, Henry moves\n    to a nondescript neighborhood, unhappy to leave his exciting gangster\n    life to live as a boring, average \"<a href=\"schnook\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">schnook</a>\".</p>\n    <p>The end title cards state that (as of 1990, when the film was\n    released) Henry is still a protected witness but that he was arrested in\n    1987 in <a href=\"Seattle\" title=\"wikilink\">Seattle</a> for narcotics\n    conspiracy. Henry received five years of <a href=\"probation\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">probation</a> but has since been clean. He and Karen\n    separated in 1989, and Paulie died the previous year in <a\n    href=\"Federal_Medical_Center,_Fort_Worth\" title=\"wikilink\">Fort Worth\n    Federal Prison</a> from respiratory illness. Jimmy is serving a 20\n    years-to-life sentence in a New York prison for murder and would be\n    eligible for parole in 2004.</p>\n    <section id=\"footnotes\" class=\"footnotes footnotes-end-of-document\"\n    role=\"doc-endnotes\">",

When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via\n    Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot\n    answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third—the name of the\n    <a href=\"informant\" title=\"wikilink\">informant</a> who gave the GCPD\n    information that led to a historic drug bust ending mobster <a\n    href=\"Salvatore_Maroni\" title=\"wikilink\">Salvatore Maroni</a>'s\n    operation—and dies. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be\n    the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's\n    operation transferred to Falcone, with many corrupt GCPD officers\n    involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal\n    money and discovers Annika's corpse in a car trunk. After a car chase,\n    Batman captures the Penguin but learns he is not the informant.</p>\n    <p>Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an\n    orphanage funded by Bruce's murdered parents, <a href=\"Thomas_Wayne\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">Thomas</a> and <a href=\"Martha_Wayne\"\n    title=\"wikilink\">Martha Wayne</a>, where they learn that the Riddler\n    holds a grudge against the Wayne family.

Bruce, who grew up believing his\n    father was morally upstanding, confronts Alfred, who maintains that\n    Thomas only asked Falcone to threaten the journalist into silence;\n    Thomas planned to turn himself and Falcone over to the police once he\n    found out Falcone murdered the journalist instead. Alfred believes that\n    Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to prevent this.</p>\n    <p>Selina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her neglectful father. She\n    decides to kill him after learning that he strangled Annika because\n    Mitchell told her that Falcone was the informant. Batman and Gordon\n    arrive in time to stop her, but the Riddler kills Falcone as he is being\n    arrested. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton\n    and is incarcerated in <a href=\"Arkham_Asylum\" title=\"wikilink\">Arkham\n    State Hospital</a>, where he tells Batman he took inspiration from him\n    when targeting the corrupt. Batman learns that Nashton has stationed <a\n    href=\"car_bomb\" title=\"wikilink\">car bombs</a> around Gotham and\n    cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect\n    Bella Reál.</p>\n    <p>The bombs destroy the <a href=\"seawall\" title=\"wikilink\">seawall</a>\n    around Gotham and flood the city.
