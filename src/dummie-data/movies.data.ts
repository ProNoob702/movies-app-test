  by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks and Ridley Scott signed on to
  direct the film. Principal photography, which began in January 1999 and
  wrapped up in May of that year, was known to have a set of problems due
  to the script being unfinished, with several of the cast complained
  about the writing quality throughout the nineteen week shoot in <a

  also created a digital <a href="body_double" title="wikilink">body

  due to Reed dying of a heart attack during production.</p>
  <p><em>Gladiator</em> was anticipated to become one of 2000's most
  successful films. Upon its release, the film grossed over $460.5 million
  worldwide, making it the <a href="2000_in_film#Highest-grossing_films"
  title="wikilink">second highest-grossing film of 2000</a>, finishing
  behind <a href="Mission:_Impossible_2" title="wikilink"><em>Mission:

  critics with praise for the acting (particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's

  musical score, and the production values. The film won multiple awards,
  including five at the <a href="73rd_Academy_Awards"

  <em>Gladiator</em> helped launched or revitalized the careers of several
  cast and crew members, particularly elevating Crowe to leading man
  status and helping Phoenix breakout into the mainstream.</p>
  <p>Since its release, <em>Gladiator</em> has been critically reevaluated
  and it has been considered to be one of the best films of the 2000s and
  one of the best action films of the 21st Century. It has been credited
  with reinventing the <a href="sword-and-sandal"
  title="wikilink">sword-and-sandal</a> genre and rekindling interest in
  entertainment centered around the cultures of <a
  href="culture_of_ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greece</a>, <a
  href="culture_of_ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Rome</a>, and other time
  periods throughout world history. Several films has attempted to emulate
  <em>Gladiator</em>'s visuals, style, and tone with varying degrees of
  success. The film has been analyzed for its themes of democracy,
  fascism, the power of the people, masculinity, and <a href="stoicism"
  title="wikilink">stoicism</a>. In 2021, Scott officially announced that
  writing had begun on a sequel to the film, which would formally enter

  <p>In <a href="180" title="wikilink">180 AD</a>, <a href="Hispania"
  title="wikilink">Hispano-Roman</a> General Maximus Decimus Meridius
  intends to return home after he leads the <a href="Roman_army"

  title="wikilink">victory against the Germanic tribes</a> near <a
  href="Vindobona" title="wikilink">Vindobona</a> on the <a
  href="Limes_Germanicus" title="wikilink">Limes Germanicus</a>. Emperor
  <a href="Marcus_Aurelius" title="wikilink">Marcus Aurelius</a> tells
  Maximus that his own son, <a href="Commodus"
  title="wikilink">Commodus</a>, is unfit to rule and that he wishes
  Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save <a href="Rome"
  title="wikilink">Rome</a> from corruption and restore the <a
  href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">republic</a>. Upon hearing this,
  Commodus murders his father.</p>
  <p>Commodus proclaims himself the new emperor, asking Maximus for his
  loyalty, but the latter refuses. Maximus is arrested by the <a
  href="Praetorian_Guard" title="wikilink">Praetorian Guard</a> and is
  told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded,
  he rides for his home near <a href="Trujillo,_Cáceres"
  title="wikilink">Trujillo</a>, only to find his wife and son <a
  href="crucified" title="wikilink">crucified</a>. Maximus buries them,
  then collapses from his injuries. Slavers find him, and take him to the
  city of <a href="Zuccabar" title="wikilink">Zucchabar</a> in the Roman
  province of <a href="Mauretania_Caesariensis"
  title="wikilink">Mauretania Caesariensis</a>, where he is sold to <a
  href="Gladiator#Schools_and_training" title="wikilink">gladiator
  trainer</a> Proximo.</p>
  <p>Maximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills
  helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other
  gladiators: Hagen, a <a href="Germanic_peoples"
  title="wikilink">German</a>; and Juba, a <a href="Numidia"
  title="wikilink">Numidian</a>. Hagen related he fought with Maximus in
  Germania, while Juba encourages him that he will meet his wife and
  daughter in the afterlife. Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a
  gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to "win the
  crowd" to win his freedom.</p>
  <p>When Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's
  death, Proximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the <a
  href="Colosseum" title="wikilink">Colosseum</a>. Disguised in a masked
  helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a <a
  href="Sacred_Band_of_Carthage" title="wikilink">Carthaginian</a> in a
  re-enactment of the <a href="Battle_of_Zama" title="wikilink">Battle of
  Zama</a>. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus
  enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the
  disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his true
  identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is
  compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and his guards are
  held back from striking them down.</p>
  <p>Maximus's next fight is against a legendary undefeated gladiator,
  Tigris of <a href="Gaul" title="wikilink">Gaul</a>. Commodus has
  arranged for several tigers to be set upon Maximus during the duel;
  Maximus, however, prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but
  Maximus spares his opponent's life; to that crowd chanted "Maximus the
  Merciful". Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his
  family's deaths, but the latter turns and walks away.</p>
  <p>Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former
  legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with <a href="Lucilla"
  title="wikilink">Lucilla</a>, Commodus's sister; and Gracchus, an
  influential <a href="Senate_of_the_Roman_Empire"
  title="wikilink">senator</a>. They agree to have Maximus escape Rome to
  join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the
  <a href="Roman_Senate" title="wikilink">Roman Senate</a>. Commodus
  learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the
  conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the
  Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks.
  Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable
  Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero,
  where the latter is killed.</p>
  <p>In an effort to win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus
  to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the
  match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms
  Commodus, who demands a sword. Disgusted by his cowardly demeanor, the
  Praetorian Guard refuses to aid him. Commodus produces a hidden knife,
  but Maximus overpowers him and drives that same knife into Commodus's
  throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for
  political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator
  Gracchus to be reinstated. As he dies, he has a vision where he reunites
  with his wife and son. His friends and allies honor him as "a soldier of
  Rome", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, leaving
  the dead Commodus behind.</p>
  <p>That night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of
  Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died. He echoes Maximus'
  words <a href="Afterlife" title="wikilink">that they will see each other
  again</a>, "but not yet", as he leaves to reunite with his family.</p>

    <p>Scorsese initially titled the film <em>Wise Guy</em> and postponed
    making it; he and Pileggi later changed the title to
    <em>Goodfellas</em>. To prepare for their roles in the film, De Niro,
    Pesci and Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material
    left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and
    <a href="Ad_libitum#Drama" title="wikilink">ad-libbing</a> came out of
    rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they
    wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines
    he liked most and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked
    from during principal photography.</p>
    <p><em>Goodfellas</em> premiered at the <a
    href="47th_Venice_International_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">47th
    Venice International Film Festival</a> on September 9, 1990, where

    September 19, 1990, by <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner
    Bros.</a> The film was made on a budget of $25 million, and grossed
    $47 million. <em>Goodfellas</em> received widespread critical acclaim
    upon release: the critical consensus on <a href="Rotten_Tomatoes"
    title="wikilink">Rotten Tomatoes</a> calls it "arguably the high point
    of Martin Scorsese's career". The film was nominated for six <a

    <h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
    <p>In 1955, youngster <a href="Henry_Hill" title="wikilink">Henry
    Hill</a> becomes enamored by the criminal life and <a
    href="American_Mafia" title="wikilink">Mafia</a> presence in his working
    class Italian-American neighborhood in <a href="Brooklyn"
    title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a>. He begins working for local <em><a
    href="caporegime" title="wikilink">caporegime</a></em> Paulie Cicero and
    his associates: Jimmy "the Gent" Conway, an Irish-American truck
    hijacker and gangster, and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent.
    Henry begins as a <a href="fence_(criminal)" title="wikilink">fence</a>
    for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. The
    three associates spend most of their nights in the 1960s at the <a
    href="Copacabana_(nightclub)" title="wikilink">Copacabana nightclub</a>
    carousing with women. Henry starts dating <a href="Karen_Friedman_Hill"
    title="wikilink">Karen Friedman</a>, a Jewish woman who is initially
    troubled by Henry's criminal activities. Seduced by Henry's glamorous
    lifestyle, she marries him despite her parents' disapproval.</p>
    <p>In 1970, <a href="William_Bentvena" title="wikilink">Billy Batts</a>,
    a <a href="made_man" title="wikilink">made man</a> in the <a
    href="Gambino_crime_family" title="wikilink">Gambino crime family</a>
    recently released from prison, patronizes Tommy at a nightclub owned by
    Henry; Tommy and Jimmy beat, stab and fatally shoot Billy. The
    unsanctioned murder of a made man invites retribution; realizing this,
    Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy bury the body in upstate New York. Six months
    later, however, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for
    development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decomposing
    corpse.</p>
    <p>In 1974, Karen harasses Henry's mistress, Janice, and threatens Henry
    at gunpoint. Henry moves in with Janice, but Paulie insists that he
    should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in <a
    href="Tampa,_Florida" title="wikilink">Tampa</a> with Jimmy. Upon
    returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the
    gambler's sister, an FBI typist, and they receive ten-year prison
    sentences. To support his family on the outside, Henry has Karen smuggle
    in drugs and sells them to a fellow inmate from <a href="Pittsburgh"
    title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a>.</p>
    <p>In 1978, Henry is paroled and expands his cocaine business with Jimmy
    and Tommy against Paulie's orders. Jimmy organizes a crew to raid the <a
    href="Lufthansa_heist" title="wikilink">Lufthansa vault</a> at <a
    href="John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport" title="wikilink">John F.
    Kennedy International Airport</a>, stealing six million dollars in cash
    and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy's
    orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew
    (except Tommy and Henry) murdered. In 1979, Tommy is deceived into
    believing he is to become a made man and is murdered after walking into
    the room of <a href="Initiation_ritual_(mafia)" title="wikilink">the
    "ceremony"</a>—partly as retribution for murdering Batts, which
    infuriates Jimmy.</p>
    <p>By 1980, Henry develops a drug habit and becomes a paranoid wreck. He
    sets up another drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates but is arrested
    by narcotics agents and incarcerated. After bailing him out, Karen
    explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to
    prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving them
    penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's drug dealing, Paulie gives him
    $3,200 and ends their association. Henry meets Jimmy at a diner and is
    asked to travel on a hit assignment, but the novelty of such a request
    makes him suspicious. Henry realizes that Jimmy plans to have him and
    Karen killed, prompting his decision to become an <a href="informant"
    title="wikilink">informant</a> and enroll, with his family, into the <a
    href="United_States_Federal_Witness_Protection_Program"
    title="wikilink">witness protection program</a>. After giving sufficient
    testimony and evidence to have Paulie and Jimmy convicted, Henry moves
    to a nondescript neighborhood, unhappy to leave his exciting gangster
    life to live as a boring, average "<a href="schnook"
    title="wikilink">schnook</a>".</p>
    <p>The end title cards state that (as of 1990, when the film was
    released) Henry is still a protected witness but that he was arrested in
    1987 in <a href="Seattle" title="wikilink">Seattle</a> for narcotics
    conspiracy. Henry received five years of <a href="probation"
    title="wikilink">probation</a> but has since been clean. He and Karen
    separated in 1989, and Paulie died the previous year in <a
    href="Federal_Medical_Center,_Fort_Worth" title="wikilink">Fort Worth
    Federal Prison</a> from respiratory illness. Jimmy is serving a 20
    years-to-life sentence in a New York prison for murder and would be
    eligible for parole in 2004.</p>

    <h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
    <p>Lifelong friends Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey are Miami police
    detectives investigating $100 million of seized Mafia heroin, which was
    stolen from a secure police vault. <a
    href="Internal_affairs_(law_enforcement)" title="wikilink">Internal
    Affairs</a> suspects that it was an inside job and threatens to shut
    down the entire department unless they recover the drugs within 72
    hours.</p>
    <p>Mike asks one of his informants and ex-girlfriend Maxine "Max" Logan
    to look for people who are newly rich and therefore suspects. She gets
    herself and her best friend Julie Mott hired as escorts by Eddie
    Dominguez, a crooked former cop. The party is soon interrupted by
    Dominguez's French drug kingpin boss Fouchet and his henchmen Casper,
    Ferguson, and Noah. Dominguez and Max are killed, while Julie manages to
    escape. The <a href="prostitution" title="wikilink">madam</a> who hired
    Julie and Max is <a href="Murder" title="wikilink">disposed of</a> by
    Noah, who then knocks out Mike as he investigates Max's death.</p>
    <p>Frantically calling the police station, Julie insists on talking only
    to Mike, who is away. Knowing she never met Mike, captain Conrad Howard
    forces Marcus to impersonate Mike to talk to her. At her apartment,
    Marcus and Julie are attacked by some of Fouchet's henchmen, one of whom
    Marcus kills. When they rendezvous with Mike, Marcus and Mike have to
    impersonate each other, with Mike living at the Burnett residence while
    Marcus resides with Julie at Mike's apartment. The two struggle to keep
    it up in Julie's presence, and she quickly begins to suspect the
    truth.</p>
    <p>Looking through mugshots, Julie identifies Noah as one of the
    henchmen. The trio go to Club Hell, one of Noah's known hangouts. After
    being spotted, Marcus knocks Casper unconscious during a bathroom fight.
    Julie tries to kill Fouchet but Marcus stops her. In the ensuing car
    chase, Mike kills Noah. The three manage to get away, but are caught on
    camera by a news helicopter and the report is later seen by Marcus's
    family, who were told that Marcus was temporarily reassigned to
    Cleveland.</p>
    <p>Mike and Marcus meet their old informant Jojo and learn about the
    location of the chemist who is cutting the stolen drugs. The three
    return to Mike's apartment, where Marcus' wife Theresa confronts them
    and confirms Julie's suspicion they have been impersonating each other.
    Fouchet's gang shows up and kidnaps Julie.</p>
    <p>Mike and Marcus' department is shut down by Internal Affairs. Despite
    being reassigned, Howard delays the order, giving Mike and Marcus more
    time to solve the case. They access Dominguez's private police database
    profile and learn that the police secretary Francine is Dominguez's
    former girlfriend, who was being blackmailed by Fouchet and Dominguez
    after they took nude photos of her, threatening to post them at her
    kids' school.</p>
    <p>Marcus, Mike and two other detectives, Sanchez and Ruiz, head to the
    <a href="Miami-Opa_Locka_Executive_Airport" title="wikilink">Miami-Opa

    concrete barrier. As Fouchet tries to flee, Mike shoots Fouchet in the
    leg and arrests him at gunpoint. After a tense conversation with Marcus,
    Fouchet surreptitiously draws a gun but is shot to death by Mike before
    he can kill Marcus, avenging Max's death. An exhausted Marcus leaves
    Julie with Mike and heads home, eager to be reunited with his wife.</p>

    released a theatrical spin-off of their <a

    title="wikilink"><em>Spider-Man</em> TV series</a> at the Tōei Cartoon
    Festival. The film was directed by Kōichi Takemoto, who also directed
    eight episodes of the TV series. The week after the film's release, a
    character introduced in the film, Jūzō Mamiya (played by Noboru Nakaya),
    began appearing in episodes of the TV series. The film was released on
    July 22, 1978. Like the rest of the series, the film was made available
    for streaming on Marvel's official website in 2009.</p>

    <p>On Halloween, <a href="Gotham_City" title="wikilink">Gotham City</a>
    mayor Don Mitchell Jr. is murdered by the <a href="Riddler"
    title="wikilink">Riddler</a>, a masked killer. Reclusive billionaire
    Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante <a
    href="Batman" title="wikilink">Batman</a>, investigates the murder
    alongside the <a href="Gotham_City_Police_Department"
    title="wikilink">Gotham City Police Department</a> (GCPD). Lieutenant <a
    href="Jim_Gordon_(character)" title="wikilink">James Gordon</a>
    discovers a message that the Riddler left for Batman. The following
    night, the Riddler kills commissioner Pete Savage and leaves another
    message for Batman.</p>
    <p>Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a <a
    href="thumb_drive" title="wikilink">thumb drive</a> in Mitchell's car
    containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika Kosolov, at the <a
    href="Iceberg_Lounge" title="wikilink">Iceberg Lounge</a>—a nightclub
    operated by the <a href="Penguin_(character)"
    title="wikilink">Penguin</a>, mobster <a href="Carmine_Falcone"
    title="wikilink">Carmine Falcone</a>'s lieutenant. While the Penguin
    pleads ignorance, Batman notices that <a href="Selina_Kyle"
    title="wikilink">Selina Kyle</a>, Annika's roommate, works at the club
    as a waitress. When Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina back to the
    Iceberg Lounge for answers and discovers that Savage was on Falcone's
    payroll, as is <a href="district_attorney" title="wikilink">district
    attorney</a> Gil Colson.</p>
    <p>The Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed <a href="collar_bomb"
    title="wikilink">collar bomb</a> to his neck, and sends him to interrupt
    Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via
    Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot
    answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third—the name of the
    <a href="informant" title="wikilink">informant</a> who gave the GCPD
    information that led to a historic drug bust ending mobster <a
    href="Salvatore_Maroni" title="wikilink">Salvatore Maroni</a>'s
    operation—and dies. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be
    the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's
    operation transferred to Falcone, with many corrupt GCPD officers
    involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal
    money and discovers Annika's corpse in a car trunk. After a car chase,
    Batman captures the Penguin but learns he is not the informant.</p>
    <p>Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an
    orphanage funded by Bruce's murdered parents, <a href="Thomas_Wayne"
    title="wikilink">Thomas</a> and <a href="Martha_Wayne"
    title="wikilink">Martha Wayne</a>, where they learn that the Riddler
    holds a grudge against the Wayne family. Bruce's butler and caretaker,
    <a href="Alfred_Pennyworth" title="wikilink">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, is
    hospitalized after opening a <a href="letter_bomb"
    title="wikilink">letter bomb</a> addressed to Bruce. The Riddler <a
    href="News_leak" title="wikilink">leaks</a> evidence that Thomas, who
    was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill a
    journalist for threatening to reveal details about Martha and her
    family's history of mental illness. Bruce, who grew up believing his
    father was morally upstanding, confronts Alfred, who maintains that
    Thomas only asked Falcone to threaten the journalist into silence;
    Thomas planned to turn himself and Falcone over to the police once he
    found out Falcone murdered the journalist instead. Alfred believes that
    Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to prevent this.</p>
    <p>Selina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her neglectful father. She
    decides to kill him after learning that he strangled Annika because
    Mitchell told her that Falcone was the informant. Batman and Gordon
    arrive in time to stop her, but the Riddler kills Falcone as he is being
    arrested. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton
    and is incarcerated in <a href="Arkham_Asylum" title="wikilink">Arkham
    State Hospital</a>, where he tells Batman he took inspiration from him
    when targeting the corrupt. Batman learns that Nashton has stationed <a
    href="car_bomb" title="wikilink">car bombs</a> around Gotham and
    cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect
    Bella Reál.</p>
    <p>The bombs destroy the <a href="seawall" title="wikilink">seawall</a>
    around Gotham and flood the city. Nashton's followers attempt to kill
    Reál but are stopped by Batman and Selina. In the aftermath, Nashton
    befriends another inmate, while Selina deems Gotham beyond saving and
    leaves. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in
    Gotham.</p>
